# Assembly Programs for Computer Organization and Architecture

## Overview

Welcome to the **Assembly Programs** repository! This project contains a collection of **MARIE** assembly language programs focused on **Computer Organization** and **Architecture**. MARIE is a simple, educational assembly language designed to help understand the inner workings of computer architecture. These programs demonstrate fundamental concepts in assembly programming, covering algorithms and operations that showcase low-level computer processes.

## Programs Included

This repository includes the following assembly programs, written in **MARIE assembly language**:

- **Fibonacci Sequence Program**: A program to compute the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Factorial Program**: A program to calculate the factorial of a number.

Each program illustrates key concepts in **computer organization** and **architecture**, such as memory management, control flow, and basic algorithms at the assembly level.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on experience with **MARIE assembly language** and demonstrate the practical applications of assembly programming in understanding **computer architecture**. These programs focus on basic algorithms like the **factorial** and **Fibonacci sequence**, offering a deeper understanding of how computers execute low-level operations.
